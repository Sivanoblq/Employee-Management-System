Code First with ApplicationDbContext :
dentity for role-based access control. The ApplicationDbContext class manages the database operations, migrations, and model relationships.
Code First Approach: The database schema is generated based on model definitions.
ASP.NET Identity: Manages roles and user authentication.
Relationships: Configures one-to-many relationships and cascades using Fluent API in ApplicationDbContext.
Migrations: Changes to the model structure are managed via migrations.
Defines roles like Admin, HR, or Employee, and supports ASP.NET Identity.
ApplicationDbContext Configuration
The ApplicationDbContext class, which inherits from IdentityDbContext, is configured with the following key aspects:

Entities:
DbSet<Employee>: Employee information.
DbSet<Role>: Role-based access.
DbSet<LeaveRequest>: Leave requests by employees.
DbSet<Attendance>: Employee attendance records.
Relationships:

Employee to Role: Configured as a one-to-many relationship.
Employee to LeaveRequest: Configured as a one-to-many relationship.
Employee to Attendance: Configured as a one-to-many relationship.

Dependency Injection and Service Configuration
The following services and repositories are registered in Program.cs:

DbContext: Configured with PostgreSQL.
Repositories: Generic and specific repositories are injected using Scoped lifetime.
Services: Includes employee, leave request, attendance services, etc.
Validators: Automatically applies FluentValidation for model validation.
AutoMapper: Maps between models and DTOs.

JWT Authentication
The JWT configuration uses a secret key from the configuration file. Ensure the key is at least 32 bytes for security. JWT is used for authenticating users and authorizing API endpoints.
Swagger is configured to document and test API endpoints with JWT support. Access Swagger at /swagger.

The Employee_System.Dto_s namespace contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), which are used for data transfer between the client and server in a simplified format. They allow for efficient communication and separation between the API and the underlying database entities.

The AttendanceDTO class represents attendance data in a structured form. It is primarily used for data retrieval, providing essential details about an employee's attendance record.

Properties:
The AttendanceDTO class represents attendance data in a structured form. It is primarily used for data retrieval, providing essential details about an employee's attendance record.
AttendanceId (int): Unique identifier for the attendance record.
EmployeeId (int): Identifier for the associated employee.
CheckInTime (DateTime): Time when the employee checked in.
CheckOutTime (DateTime): Time when the employee checked out.
WorkHours (double): Total hours worked by the employee during the attendance period.
The CreateAttendanceDTO class is used for creating new attendance records. It focuses on the input fields required to register an employee's attendance
EmployeeId (int): Identifier for the associated employee.
CheckInTime (DateTime): Time when the employee checked in.
CheckOutTime (DateTime): Time when the employee checked out.
These DTOs facilitate structured data transfer for attendance-related operations, streamlining interactions between the client and server and ensuring only necessary data is exposed.

The services are built using dependency injection and interface-based design for flexibility, testability, and separation of concerns. Below are details of the main services and their functionalities.
Each service handles specific data-related functionalities for entities in the Employee Management System. They use Unit of Work, Repository patterns, and a Cache layer to optimize performance and handle data transactions. Each service has an associated interface that defines its public methods, promoting modularity and easy testing.

Services Overview
Each service handles specific data-related functionalities for entities in the Employee Management System. They use Unit of Work, Repository patterns, and a Cache layer to optimize performance and handle data transactions. Each service has an associated interface that defines its public methods, promoting modularity and easy testing.

1. AttendanceService (IAttendanceService)
The AttendanceService manages attendance records and supports caching to minimize database calls.

Key Methods:

GetAttendanceByIdAsync: Retrieves an attendance record by ID. First checks the cache before querying the database.
GetAllAttendancesAsync: Returns all attendance records.
AddAttendanceAsync: Creates a new attendance record and caches it.
UpdateAttendanceAsync: Updates an attendance record and refreshes the cache.
DeleteAttendanceAsync: Deletes an attendance record and removes it from the cache.
Dependencies:

IUnitOfWork: For managing transactions.
IAttendanceTrackingStrategy: Used to calculate work hours based on the tracking strategy.
LoggerService: For error logging.
AttendanceCacheService: Singleton cache service to store attendance data.
2. EmployeeService (IEmployeeService)
The EmployeeService manages employee data and uses caching to improve retrieval efficiency.

Key Methods:

GetAllEmployeesAsync: Retrieves all employees without caching, as it could be memory-intensive.
GetEmployeeByIdAsync: Fetches an employee by ID, with caching to avoid repeated database queries.
AddEmployeeAsync: Adds a new employee and caches the record.
UpdateEmployeeAsync: Updates an employee's information and refreshes the cache.
DeleteEmployeeAsync: Deletes an employee and removes it from the cache.
Dependencies:

IUnitOfWork: For database transactions.
LoggerService: Logs any errors or exceptions.
EmployeeCacheService: Caches individual employee data.
3. LeaveRequestService (ILeaveRequestService)
The LeaveRequestService handles leave requests with similar caching and logging as the other services. It also uses the Factory Pattern to create leave requests based on their type.

Key Methods:

GetAllLeaveRequestsAsync: Fetches all leave requests, without caching due to potential size.
GetLeaveRequestByIdAsync: Retrieves a leave request by ID, with caching.
AddLeaveRequestAsync: Creates a leave request using the factory pattern and caches the result.
UpdateLeaveRequestAsync: Updates leave request data and refreshes the cache.
DeleteLeaveRequestAsync: Deletes a leave request and removes it from the cache.
Dependencies:

IUnitOfWork: Manages transactions for data consistency.
LeaveRequestFactory: Creates leave requests based on the type of leave.
LoggerService: Logs errors and operational messages.
LeaveRequestCacheService: Singleton cache service for leave requests.
Key Components and Patterns
Unit of Work
The Unit of Work (UoW) pattern ensures that each service's database operations (like Add, Update, Delete) are encapsulated in a single transaction, enabling rollback on errors and promoting consistent data handling.

Caching
The Cache Services (AttendanceCacheService, EmployeeCacheService, LeaveRequestCacheService) are singleton instances that improve performance by storing frequently accessed data, reducing redundant database calls.

Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern is used in the LeaveRequestService to create leave requests based on specific types, enhancing flexibility and reducing conditional logic within the service.

LoggerService
The LoggerService provides centralized logging for all services, capturing errors, exceptions, and operational messages to help diagnose issues and improve observability.

Usage
These services can be injected into controllers or other classes where data operations are needed. The interface-based design also allows for easy mocking in unit tests.

# Employee Management System (EMS)
 
## Overview
 
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a robust web application built using ASP.NET Core and .NET 8, designed to streamline the management of employees, leave requests, and attendance tracking. The application integrates secure JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and leverages design patterns such as the Repository, Unit of Work, Factory, and Strategy patterns to promote scalable and maintainable code.
 
## Features
 
- **Employee Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for employee profiles.
- **Leave Request Management**: Employees can submit leave requests, and administrators can review and update their status.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Track employee attendance on an hourly or daily basis using a Strategy pattern.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Role-based permissions to restrict specific actions to admin users.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure user authentication and authorization.
 
## Architecture & Design Patterns
 
### Repository Pattern
Used for data access logic encapsulation. Each model, such as `Employee`, `LeaveRequest`, and `Attendance`, has its own repository interface and implementation, ensuring clean separation of concerns and testability.
 
### Unit of Work Pattern
The Unit of Work pattern is implemented to manage and coordinate transactions across multiple repositories, ensuring data integrity. The Unit of Work class aggregates multiple repository operations into a single transaction, minimizing database calls and providing a rollback mechanism in case of errors. This is particularly useful for complex operations that span multiple entities, such as processing leave requests and updating attendance records.
 
### Factory Pattern
Utilized to create instances for different leave types. A factory class is responsible for returning the correct type of leave request, making it easier to add or modify leave types without changing core logic.
 
### Strategy Pattern
Applied in the attendance module to handle different attendance calculation strategies, such as hourly and daily maintenance. This allows the system to dynamically choose the correct attendance tracking strategy based on the employee type or department requirements.
 
## Project Structure
 
- **Controllers**: Define API endpoints for interacting with Employee, LeaveRequest, and Attendance resources.
- **Models**: Data models representing core entities, including `Employee`, `LeaveRequest`, and `Attendance`.
- **Data**: Contains `DbContext` and database migrations.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects used for API requests and responses.
- **Repositories**: Implements the Repository pattern with interfaces and classes for data access logic.
- **UnitOfWork**: A class that manages transactions across multiple repositories, using a single instance of the `DbContext`.
- **Services**: Business logic layer, including Factory and Strategy pattern implementations.
- **Middleware**: Configured JWT authentication and authorization for secure access.
